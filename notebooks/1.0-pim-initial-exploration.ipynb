    "# Initial Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on the original [DeepPiCar](https://github.com/dctian/DeepPiCar) project which simply uses a Raspberry Pi with a camera on a simple radio controlled car. A vary similiar project [DeepPicar-v2](https://github.com/mbechtel2/DeepPicar-v2) done by members of University of Kansas. The DeepPiCar has data as well as the angles embedded in the images while DeepPicar-v2 has modulated the angles to $\\lbrace -30, 0, +30\\rbrace$ degrees on its outputs. Both are using the convolutional neural network architecture of the [DAVE-2](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) so for now training will only be done on the DeepPiCar data and comparison with their model.\n",
